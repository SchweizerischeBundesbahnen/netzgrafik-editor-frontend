### Long-term goals on the roadmap

- **Integration in existing landscape of tools:**
  Integrate the developed tools with existing
  timetabling, demand simulation, and forecasting tools.

- **Compare existing demand forecast with designed supply:**
  Analyze and compare the forecasted demand with the planned supply.

- **Automatically derive timetables from demand:**
  Develop algorithms to automatically generate timetables based on the
  predicted demand.

- **Circulation and requirements for rolling stock:**
  Evaluate the circulation and rolling stock requirements based on the
  planned timetables.

- **Actual/target comparison of mesoscopic infrastructure:**
  Compare the actual/existing infrastructure with the target infrastructure

## Ideas for the roadmap:

Efficiently design and compare different variants of multimodal timetables/concepts.
Gain insights by extracting the entered information through smart projection and analytics
capabilities.
These goals and ideas indicate a focus on improving travel time analysis, ensuring compliance with
business rules, and integrating various tools for better planning and decision-making. Additionally,
the ideas emphasize the importance of efficient design, data analysis, and gaining insights from the
collected information.
